### Installation of Node.js
First, make sure that you have Node.js v18.16.0 installed on your system. Download and install it from the [official Node.js website.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Note: You can install a different version of Node.js using a version manager such as Node Version Manager (NVM). For Unix-based systems (Linux and macOS), use NVM. For Windows systems, [use nvm-windows.](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)

### Installing Yarn
Once Node.js is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Yarn using npm (Node Package Manager):

`npm install -g yarn`
Verify the installation by running:

`yarn --version`

### Running the Project
1. Open the environment folder inside your IDE.

2. Change the directory to where the environment folder is located in the terminal or command prompt. For example:

`cd C:\Users\user\WebStormProjects\environment`

3. Run the command:

`yarn install`

4. Run the command:

`yarn dev`

5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should see "Hello, Next.js!".
